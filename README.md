# beerbot

Beerbot is a free discord bot used to log beer ratings and display various charts based on those ratings.
It also has a few other commands detailed below

- backed by Google Cloud Firestore - a scalable NoSQL database
- node.js runtime 

## Installation

Prerequisite steps:

<ol>
<li>Install git on your machine and pull down this repo</li>
<li>Install the latest version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> </li>
<li>create a `.env` file containing the command prefix and discord bot token </li>
<li>download GCP service credentials in a json format - store this somewhere safe and double check the reference in index.js
</ol>

Note: [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) is a great tool to manage node versions - check it out

Start building! 

```
npm install
```

This will install all of the neccessary node modules and create a new "node modules" folder in the base project

```
node index.js
```

This starts up a local node process to run the bot on your machine - feel free to test away in a discord server.

Note: production version will be ran in GCP - some code may need to change for this.
